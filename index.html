By leveraging the Moralis API, this project not only streamlined data retrieval but also deepened my understanding of APIs and the crypto ecosystem. The main goal was to enhance the speed of gathering relevant wallet information, and I’m proud to say it accomplished exactly that!</td>

So far, I’ve been focusing on class diagrams and structuring the project, laying a solid foundation before diving into development. Over the next few weeks, I’ll be actively working on it while also learning C#, SHA-256, and much more. What makes this project special to me is that it’s an idea I came up with on my own—something that truly interests me. I’m confident it will be a great learning experience, helping me build valuable skills along the way!</td>

As a member of the men's volleyball club at Charlotte, this project is especially meaningful to me. I wanted to create something that not only showcases the team but also helps connect with others who share the same passion for the sport. Along the way, I’ve been able to sharpen my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making this both a fun and valuable learning experience. Combining coding and volleyball—two of my favorite things—has made this project incredibly rewarding!</td>
